**How to play Codeword**

Codeword is like a crossword puzzle, but with a twist â€” no clues are provided! Instead of letters, each alphabet character is substituted with a unique number consistently used throughout the puzzle.

Your task is to decode which number corresponds to which letter!

To kickstart your journey, we unveil 3 letters initially.

As you input these deciphered letters across the grid, you'll gradually gather adequate clues to deduce words and unravel additional letter codes.
